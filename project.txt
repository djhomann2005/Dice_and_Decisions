Goal: Create a browser-based tool that:

2. Clicking it rolls a die (1-20)
3. Displays the result
4. Displays a message based on the roll

Rules (Example)
-1-5 -> Failure
-6-14 -> Mixed Result
-15-20 -> Success

Requirements:

2. At least one function
3. Conditional logic (if/else)
4. Diaplay result in the UI

Plan:
1. Develop website skeleton
    -Title banner
    -Instructions
    -Button: Roll d20
2. Button click causes a random number 1-20 to be generated
    -onclick: generate random number between 1 & 20
    -return result
3. Result is displayed to user on webpage
    -Add display box and legend
    -Show result
4. Display message based on roll
    -Add message to display box
    -1-7: No - "The Oracle says no"
    -8-13: Maybe - "The Oracle says maybe. Either it is a partial result, or reroll if a yes/no answer is needed"
    -14-20: Yes - "The Oracle says yes"
5. Steps 2-4 can be done infinitely
