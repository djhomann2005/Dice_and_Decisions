--- Level 1 ---
Goal: Create a browser-based tool that:
1. Has a button
2. Clicking it rolls a die (1-20)
3. Displays the result
4. Displays a message based on the roll

Rules (Example)
-1-5 -> Failure
-6-14 -> Mixed Result
-15-20 -> Success

Requirements:
1. JavaScript logic
2. At least one function
3. Conditional logic (if/else)
4. Diaplay result in the UI

Plan:
1. Develop website skeleton
    -Title banner
    -Instructions
    -Button: Roll d20
2. Button click causes a random number 1-20 to be generated
    -onclick: generate random number between 1 & 20
    -return result
3. Result is displayed to user on webpage
    -Add display box and legend
    -Show result
4. Display message based on roll
    -Add message to display box
    -1-7: No - "The Oracle says no"
    -8-13: Maybe - "The Oracle says maybe. Either it is a partial result, or reroll if a yes/no answer is needed"
    -14-20: Yes - "The Oracle says yes"
5. Steps 2-4 can be done infinitely


Level 1 — Foundation (You should be able to do this)
Goal
    Create a browser-based tool that:
    Has a button
    Clicking it rolls a die (1–20)
    Displays the result
    Displays a message based on the roll

Rules (Example)
    1–5 → “Failure”
    6–14 → “Mixed result”
    15–20 → “Success”

Requirements
    JavaScript logic
    At least one function
    Conditional logic (if / else)
    Display result in the UI



🧩 Level 2 — State & Structure (React comes in)
Rebuild the same idea using React.

Additions
    Store the roll result in state
    Store the message in state
    Clicking the button updates state
    UI re-renders based on state

Stretch Thinking
    What is data?
    What changes?
    What triggers change?


🧩 Level 3 — Player Choice (Decision-Making)
Add one decision before the roll.
Example:
    “Play it safe”
    “Take a risk”

Mechanics
    Safe → roll 2d10, take the higher
    Risk → roll 1d20, but failure is worse

Now you’re modeling:
    inputs
    rules
    outcomes
    This is core game logic thinking.

🧩 Level 4 — Data-Driven Design (This is a big step)
Move outcomes into data, not logic.

Example:
    const outcomes = [
    { min: 1, max: 5, text: "Critical failure" },
    { min: 6, max: 14, text: "Partial success" },
    { min: 15, max: 20, text: "Great success" }
    ];

Then:
    loop over data
    find the matching range
    display the result

🧩 Level 5 — Visualization (Optional, but fun)
Add:
    a roll history list
    or a simple bar chart using plain divs
    or percentages after 50+ rolls
    No libraries required.

This reinforces:
    .map()
    keys
    rendering lists
    state accumulation

🧩 Level 6 — Narrative Flavor (Very “you”)
Add light text like:
    “You attempt to cross the unstable bridge…”
    Outcome text changes based on roll.

This connects:
    logic
    presentation
    storytelling
